## What is it?

MerAuctions is an online live auction portal where users can register for multiple auction and submit bids to buy a product. When the auction ends, the bidder who chose the highest value is declared the winner.

## How do run locally?

brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community@4.2
mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf --fork
ps -ef | grep mongod #check if mongodb is working
```

### Start the App

```
go run cmd/auctions/merauctions.go --mongodb-url=mongodb://localhost:27017/testing --database=testing
```

- If you want to populate initial data you can run `cd server/seed-data/ && go run seeddb.go`
